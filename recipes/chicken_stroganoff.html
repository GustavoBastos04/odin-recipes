            Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken pieces over a medium high heat, stirring frequently. until golden brown. Season and transfer to a plate.

            Heat the remaining oil and lower the heat to medium. Fry the onion for 6-8 mins until softened but not golden, then stir in the garlic and paprika.

            Over a low heat, stir in the soured cream until just combined to create a creamy sauce, and it’s just started to simmer. Scatter over the parsley and serve with rice, mash or pasta, if you like.
